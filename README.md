# Webbutvecklingsprojekt - microswag.online

This was the website I made for the web development course I took in 2019 at Elof Lind√§lvs gymnasium.
If I remember correctly, we also got to deploy the sites to a webhotel. Hence the name, microswag.online.

Install dependencies with `npm i` and run with `npm run dev`.
